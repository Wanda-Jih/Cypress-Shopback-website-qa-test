Cypress is a purely JavaScript-based front end testing tool built for the modern web. It aims to address the pain points developers or QA engineers face while testing an application. Cypress is a more developer-friendly tool that uses a unique DOM manipulation technique and operates directly in the browser. Cypress also provides a unique interactive test runner in which it executes all commands.



### Test Cases

These test cases are the most commonly used, and if they could be automated, it would save a lot of time for those manual testers.
